# 2023-01-24: Overview of updated clades

## H3N2

The recent clade update splits the previous 3C.2a1b.2a.1 and 3C.2a1b.2a.2 into a number of subclades.
To shorten the clade labels, the prefix 3C.2a1b.2a will be dropped in much of the discussion as no viruses outside this group have been observed in a while.
The current breakdown is meant to capture the dynamics of currently circulating phylogenetic distinct subclades.

These clades can be assigned to HA sequences using [Nextclade](https://clades.nextstrain.org/?dataset-name=flu_h3n2_ha).

## H1N1pdm

Global circulation is completely dominated by 6B.1A.5 and its descendants. The abbreviated clade names therefore drop the prefix _6B.1A_.
Clade 5a, defined by HA1 substitutions N129D and T185I on top of 6B.1A.5, had split into two long-lived clades broken up further below.

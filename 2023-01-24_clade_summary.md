# 2023-01-24: Overview of updated clades

## H3N2

The recent clade update splits the previous 3C.2a1b.2a.1 and 3C.2a1b.2a.2 into a number of subclades.
To shorten the clade labels, the prefix 3C.2a1b.2a will be dropped in much of the discussion as no viruses outside this group have been observed in a while.
The current breakdown is meant to capture the dynamics of currently circulating phylogenetic distinct subclades.
